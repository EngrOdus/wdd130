                        <figcaption>Ikpoba River is a waterway in southern Nigeria, traversing Edo State and providing resources for the inhabitants of Benin City and nearby areas. Rising from the Ishan Plateau, the river flows through Benin City and drains a basin area of approximately 922 km2 (356 sq mi). It supplies freshwater, generates hydroelectric power, and supports agricultural irrigation. The river's hydrology is influenced by seasonal rainfall variations. Baseflow contributes about 56% of its total discharge, while the remaining 44% comes from overland flow. In its upper sections, the river exhibits a dendritic drainage pattern and is sustained by groundwater from the Benin Formation, ensuring a relatively consistent flow throughout the year.</figcaption>

                        <figcaption>The River Ethiope is a significant inland waterway in Nigeria, particularly in Delta State, and is known for its crystal-clear waters and rich biodiversity. It is considered one of the deepest and cleanest rivers in Nigeria, and a popular tourist destination. The river is formed at the foot of a giant silk cotton tree in Umuaja, Ukuwani City, Delta, and flows into Sapele. </figcaption>

                        <figcaption>The Niger River is the main river of West Africa, extending about 4,180 kilometres (2,600 miles). Its drainage basin is 2,117,700 km2 (817,600 sq mi) in area. Its source is in the Guinea Highlands in south-eastern Guinea near the Sierra Leone border. It runs in a crescent shape through Mali, Niger, on the border with Benin and then through Nigeria, discharging through a massive delta, known as the Niger Delta, into the Gulf of Guinea in the Atlantic Ocean. The Niger is the third-longest river in Africa, exceeded by the Nile and the Congo River. Its main tributary is the Benue River.</figcaption>

                        <figcaption>Benue River, previously known as the Chadda River or Tchadda, is a major tributary of the Niger River. The size of its catchment basin is 319,000 km2 (123,000 sq mi). Almost its entire length of approximately 1,400 kilometres (870 mi) is navigable during the summer months. As a result, it is an important transportation route in the regions through which it flows. The name Benue comes from Binuwe, meaning 'Mother of Waters in the Batta language.</figcaption>
